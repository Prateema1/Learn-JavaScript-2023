## What is Lexical Environment?

-- Lexical environment is the local memory along with its lexical parent's scope. In simple words, lexically present means present in a heirarchy.

-- Whenever execution context is created lexical environment is also crated along with its local memory. That lexical environment has reference to its parent's scope.

## The Scope Chain

-- Scope chain is the chain of all the lexical environment and its parent reference. When JS doesn't find the value in its local memory, it goes through the scope chain and returns the value.

## What is Scope?

-- Scope is simply where we can access the variables and functions in our code.
